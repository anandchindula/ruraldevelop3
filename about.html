            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>At Rural Development, our mission is to empower rural communities by providing sustainable solutions that improve livelihoods, promote economic development, and preserve the environment. We collaborate with local governments, NGOs, and private sectors to deliver programs focused on education, infrastructure, healthcare, and agriculture.</p>
            <p>We believe that rural areas are the backbone of any nation, and our vision is to create thriving, self-sustained rural economies where people live with dignity and access the same opportunities as urban areas. Join us in creating a better future for rural communities.</p>
